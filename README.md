For my UCLA capstone, I'm designing an alternative procedure that can be performed by an electromagnetically locomoted capsule during an office visit, whose vertical position (at the intersection of the sagittal and coronal planes) can be controlled by a passive medical grade string. 
If this endeavor succeeds, the future of the GI Tract biopsy could become much more accessible, affordable, and efficient for patients. A capsule-based biopsy would be minimally invasive, eliminate the need for an operating room or anesthesia, and allow doctors to collect samples in a much smaller time frame.
